# magLab
* Utilities for the learning of magnetic exploration methods
* Organized as independent Jupyter Notebooks (in Python)
* Minimum requirement of packages (usually only Numpy, Scipy, matplotlib)

## List of notebooks
* **MagDipole**: draw field lines from a magnetic dipole in 3D; total field anomaly map and profiles observed at given locations; support "long dipole" with non-negligible length.
